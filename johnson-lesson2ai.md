Initial Prompt:"I want to create a calculator program in python using the procedural paradigm. Initially, the feature will be for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I will add other features such as present value, mortgage payments, etc. later so the design must easily allow this.
------------------------------------------------------
Response: Here's a basic structure for your calculator program using a procedural paradigm. This design is modular, making it easy to add more features later.

### Step 1: Define Basic Operations

First, let's define the basic arithmetic functions:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y != 0:
        return x / y
    else:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
```

### Step 2: Create a Function to Handle User Input

This function will handle user input and call the appropriate operation:

```python
def get_operation_choice():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")

    choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")
    return choice

def get_numbers():
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
    return num1, num2
```

### Step 3: Main Calculator Logic

This part of the code will tie everything together:

```python
def main():
    while True:
        choice = get_operation_choice()

        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()

            if choice == '1':
                print(f"Result: {add(num1, num2)}")
            elif choice == '2':
                print(f"Result: {subtract(num1, num2)}")
            elif choice == '3':
                print(f"Result: {multiply(num1, num2)}")
            elif choice == '4':
                print(f"Result: {divide(num1, num2)}")

        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please select a valid operation.")

        next_calculation = input("Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): ")
        if next_calculation.lower() != 'yes':
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 4: Planning for Future Features

To add more complex features like present value or mortgage payments, you can create new functions and update the menu:

```python
def present_value():
    # Implementation for present value calculation
    pass

def mortgage_payment():
    # Implementation for mortgage payment calculation
    pass

def get_operation_choice():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    print("5. Present Value")
    print("6. Mortgage Payment")
    
    choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5/6): ")
    return choice
```

This approach ensures your calculator is flexible and can easily incorporate more complex calculations as needed.


2nd Prompt: "Can unit tests using `Pytest` be created to test the code easily with minimum mocking?"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
response: Yes, you can easily create unit tests using `pytest` for the calculator functions without needing much, if any, mocking since these are straightforward mathematical functions. Here's a basic guide to setting up unit tests for the calculator program:

### Step 1: Install Pytest

If you haven't already installed `pytest`, you can do so with:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Step 2: Create a Test File

Create a file named `test_calculator.py` where the test functions will reside.

### Step 3: Write Unit Tests

Here are some sample unit tests for the basic operations, focusing on verifying the correctness of each function:

```python
# test_calculator.py
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide  # Import your functions from the main calculator file

def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2
    assert add(0, 0) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
    assert subtract(-1, 1) == -2
    assert subtract(0, 0) == 0

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(2, 3) == 6
    assert multiply(-1, -1) == 1
    assert multiply(0, 5) == 0

def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5
    assert divide(-9, -3) == 3
    assert divide(0, 1) == 0
    assert divide(5, 0) == "Error: Division by zero"  # Testing division by zero
```

### Step 4: Run the Tests

You can run the tests using:

```bash
pytest test_calculator.py
```

### How the Tests Work

- **Direct Testing**: Each function is tested directly with various inputs to verify the expected outputs.
- **Minimal Mocking**: Since these functions don't depend on external state or I/O, there's no need for mocking, making the tests straightforward and clean.
- **Edge Cases**: The tests cover basic cases and some edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

This setup ensures your functions are thoroughly tested and reliable, and you can expand it easily when adding new features like present value or mortgage calculations by writing additional test cases in a similar style.


3rd Prompt: "Does the code meet the following principles? If not, where and how do I refactor? Code that meets SOLID principles as well as DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Composition over inheritance, Encapsulation, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, modular design, OOP principles. Code should be easy to maintain, easy to add features, and easy to test using `Pytest`."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Your initial code mostly adheres to procedural programming and meets several good practices such as modularity, encapsulation, and simplicity (KISS). However, to fully meet the principles of SOLID, DRY, Law of Demeter, and other best practices you mentioned, refactoring into an Object-Oriented approach will be necessary. Below, I will explain where the current code deviates and provide a refactored version that aligns with these principles.

### Principles and How the Current Code Stands:

1. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each function currently does one job, which aligns with SRP, but this can be enhanced by further encapsulating behaviors in classes.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The current design is not fully open for extension; adding new features requires modifying existing functions. We can improve by defining a structure that allows easy addition of new operations without modifying existing code.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: This principle is more applicable in an OOP context where inheritance is used, which isn't currently the case.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Not directly applicable here, but it involves having classes/interfaces that do not force dependencies on unused methods.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: The current code doesn't use dependency injection, which would allow for more flexibility in changing how things work internally without changing the class interface.

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: The code doesn't have much repetition, but some areas (e.g., getting inputs) could be refactored further.

3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: The code is simple, but separating logic and user interaction would enhance maintainability.

4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: The current design does not overcomplicate with unnecessary features, which aligns well with YAGNI.

5. **Law of Demeter**: To comply better, encapsulation in classes and clearer, direct interaction would be beneficial.

6. **Composition over Inheritance**: Not applicable as inheritance is not used; composition via functional segregation is used instead.

7. **Encapsulation, High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: The functions are cohesive, but wrapping them into classes would increase encapsulation and maintainability.

### Refactored Code to Meet All Principles

Below is a refactored version of your calculator that aligns with SOLID principles, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, modular design, and OOP principles:

```python
# calculator.py

class Operation:
    """Base class for all operations."""
    def execute(self, x, y):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses should implement this method.")


class Addition(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x + y


class Subtraction(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x - y


class Multiplication(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x * y


class Division(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        if y == 0:
            return "Error: Division by zero"
        return x / y


class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = {
            "1": Addition(),
            "2": Subtraction(),
            "3": Multiplication(),
            "4": Division()
        }

    def add_operation(self, key, operation):
        """Allows adding new operations without modifying existing code."""
        if isinstance(operation, Operation):
            self.operations[key] = operation

    def get_operation(self, choice):
        """Retrieves the selected operation based on user input."""
        return self.operations.get(choice, None)

    def perform_operation(self, operation, x, y):
        return operation.execute(x, y)


def get_operation_choice():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    return input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")


def get_numbers():
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
    return num1, num2


def main():
    calculator = Calculator()

    while True:
        choice = get_operation_choice()
        operation = calculator.get_operation(choice)

        if operation:
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            result = calculator.perform_operation(operation, num1, num2)
            print(f"Result: {result}")
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please select a valid operation.")

        next_calculation = input("Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): ")
        if next_calculation.lower() != 'yes':
            break


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Refactoring Improvements:

1. **Encapsulation and Single Responsibility**: Each operation is encapsulated in its class, adhering to SRP.
   
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: The `Calculator` class is open for extension by adding new `Operation` classes without modifying existing code.

3. **Low Coupling and High Cohesion**: The `Calculator` class only interacts with the `Operation` interface, promoting low coupling and high cohesion.

4. **Ease of Adding New Features**: Adding new operations is as simple as creating a new subclass of `Operation` and registering it in the calculator using `add_operation`.

5. **Testing with Pytest**: Each operation can be tested independently, and the `Calculator` class can be tested with minimal setup and without complex mocking.

### Sample Pytest for Refactored Code

```python
# test_calculator.py
from calculator import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Calculator

def test_addition():
    add = Addition()
    assert add.execute(1, 2) == 3
    assert add.execute(-1, -1) == -2

def test_subtraction():
    subtract = Subtraction()
    assert subtract.execute(5, 3) == 2
    assert subtract.execute(-1, 1) == -2

def test_multiplication():
    multiply = Multiplication()
    assert multiply.execute(2, 3) == 6
    assert multiply.execute(-1, -1) == 1

def test_division():
    divide = Division()
    assert divide.execute(10, 2) == 5
    assert divide.execute(5, 0) == "Error: Division by zero"

def test_calculator_operations():
    calculator = Calculator()
    assert isinstance(calculator.get_operation("1"), Addition)
    assert isinstance(calculator.get_operation("2"), Subtraction)
```

This refactored design adheres to best practices and is structured for easy maintenance, testing, and expansion, making it robust for adding future features.

4th Prompt: "Add a new feature that would require a database or JSON file. Modularize the code into at least four modules to help in team development, testing, maintenance, and minimizing refactoring while adding features."
--------------------------------------
response: To add a new feature that involves a database or JSON file, let's consider adding a **"History"** feature to keep track of all calculations performed by the user. This feature will save the history of operations into a JSON file, making it easy to retrieve past calculations.

### Refactoring into Modules

We will modularize the code into four distinct modules:

1. **`operations.py`**: Contains all the operation classes (`Addition`, `Subtraction`, `Multiplication`, `Division`).
2. **`calculator.py`**: Manages the core `Calculator` class logic, linking operations to the calculator.
3. **`io_handler.py`**: Handles user input/output and data storage in JSON files (e.g., saving and retrieving calculation history).
4. **`main.py`**: The main entry point for running the calculator program, orchestrating other modules.

### Module Design

#### 1. `operations.py`

This module handles the individual operations, encapsulating the logic for each.

```python
# operations.py

class Operation:
    """Base class for all operations."""
    def execute(self, x, y):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses should implement this method.")


class Addition(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x + y


class Subtraction(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x - y


class Multiplication(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x * y


class Division(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        if y == 0:
            return "Error: Division by zero"
        return x / y
```

#### 2. `calculator.py`

This module manages the calculator logic and handles the operations.

```python
# calculator.py

from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = {
            "1": Addition(),
            "2": Subtraction(),
            "3": Multiplication(),
            "4": Division()
        }

    def add_operation(self, key, operation):
        """Allows adding new operations without modifying existing code."""
        if isinstance(operation, Operation):
            self.operations[key] = operation

    def get_operation(self, choice):
        """Retrieves the selected operation based on user input."""
        return self.operations.get(choice, None)

    def perform_operation(self, operation, x, y):
        return operation.execute(x, y)
```

#### 3. `io_handler.py`

This module handles input/output with the user and manages the history using a JSON file.

```python
# io_handler.py

import json
import os

HISTORY_FILE = 'history.json'

def get_operation_choice():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    return input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")


def get_numbers():
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
    return num1, num2


def save_history(operation, x, y, result):
    """Saves each calculation to a JSON file for history tracking."""
    if not os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
        with open(HISTORY_FILE, 'w') as file:
            json.dump([], file)

    history_entry = {
        "operation": operation,
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "result": result
    }

    with open(HISTORY_FILE, 'r+') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        data.append(history_entry)
        file.seek(0)
        json.dump(data, file, indent=4)


def show_history():
    """Displays the history of all calculations."""
    if not os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
        print("No history available.")
        return

    with open(HISTORY_FILE, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        if not data:
            print("No history available.")
        else:
            for entry in data:
                print(f"{entry['x']} {entry['operation']} {entry['y']} = {entry['result']}")
```

#### 4. `main.py`

This is the main entry point that ties everything together.

```python
# main.py

from calculator import Calculator
from io_handler import get_operation_choice, get_numbers, save_history, show_history

def main():
    calculator = Calculator()

    while True:
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("1. Add")
        print("2. Subtract")
        print("3. Multiply")
        print("4. Divide")
        print("5. Show History")  # New feature to display history

        choice = get_operation_choice()

        if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:
            operation = calculator.get_operation(choice)
            num1, num2 = get_numbers()
            result = calculator.perform_operation(operation, num1, num2)
            print(f"Result: {result}")
            save_history(choice, num1, num2, result)  # Save to history
        elif choice == '5':
            show_history()
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please select a valid operation.")

        next_calculation = input("Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): ")
        if next_calculation.lower() != 'yes':
            break


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Benefits of the Refactored Design:

1. **Modular Design**: Each module has a specific responsibility, improving maintainability, readability, and testability.
2. **Encapsulation and Single Responsibility**: Code is neatly organized, with each module handling only its own concerns.
3. **Easily Extensible**: New operations or features (like saving to a database) can be added without modifying existing code.
4. **Testing with Pytest**: Each module can be tested independently, minimizing test dependencies and allowing focused unit tests.

### Sample Pytest for the Refactored Code

Here's a sample test setup using `pytest` for this modularized structure:

```python
# test_operations.py
from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

def test_addition():
    add = Addition()
    assert add.execute(1, 2) == 3

def test_subtraction():
    subtract = Subtraction()
    assert subtract.execute(5, 3) == 2

def test_multiplication():
    multiply = Multiplication()
    assert multiply.execute(2, 3) == 6

def test_division():
    divide = Division()
    assert divide.execute(10, 2) == 5
    assert divide.execute(5, 0) == "Error: Division by zero"

# test_calculator.py
from calculator import Calculator
from operations import Addition

def test_calculator_operations():
    calculator = Calculator()
    assert isinstance(calculator.get_operation("1"), Addition)

# test_io_handler.py
import json
import os
from io_handler import save_history, show_history

def test_save_history(tmp_path):
    history_file = tmp_path / "history.json"
    os.environ["HISTORY_FILE"] = str(history_file)  # Redirect the history file path for testing
    save_history("Addition", 1, 2, 3)
    with open(history_file, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        assert data == [{"operation": "Addition", "x": 1, "y": 2, "result": 3}]
```

This design allows for distributed development across teams, targeted testing, and clear pathways for adding future enhancements with minimal refactoring.

5th Prompt: "If I wanted to eventually turn this into a web application, what refactoring should I do to allow this in the future?"
-----------------
Response: To prepare the current code for a future transition into a web application, you can refactor the code to make it more adaptable for web frameworks like Flask or Django. The goal is to separate the core business logic from any user interface elements (CLI in the current setup) and structure the codebase in a way that allows easy integration with web request handling.

### Key Refactoring Steps

1. **Separate Business Logic from User Interaction**: The core functionality (calculations and operations) should be independent of how input/output is handled, whether it's CLI or a web interface.
  
2. **Decouple Persistence Layer**: Abstract the history management (currently using JSON) to make it easier to swap with a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL when moving to a web application.

3. **Design with Services**: Use a service layer to handle business logic, making it easier to connect the backend logic with a web frontend.

4. **API Ready**: Refactor functions so that they can be easily exposed as API endpoints, focusing on returning data structures (like dictionaries) instead of printing directly to the console.

5. **Organize the Project**: Reorganize the project structure to follow best practices seen in web applications, using directories like `services`, `models`, `controllers`, and `routes`.

### Updated Project Structure

Here's how the project can be organized for easy migration to a web app:

```
project/
│
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py        # Application initialization (for Flask/Django)
│   ├── operations.py      # Core operation classes
│   ├── calculator.py      # Calculator logic
│   ├── io_handler.py      # Input/output handlers
│   ├── services.py        # Service layer for business logic
│   ├── history_manager.py # History persistence (file or database)
│   └── routes.py          # Web routes (if using Flask, this would be endpoints)
│
├── tests/
│   ├── test_operations.py # Tests for operations
│   ├── test_calculator.py # Tests for calculator logic
│   ├── test_services.py   # Tests for service layer
│   ├── test_history.py    # Tests for history management
│   └── conftest.py        # Common test fixtures, if needed
│
├── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
└── main.py                # Main entry for CLI use; can be replaced with app.py for web
```

### Refactored Code

Here's how you can refactor each part to prepare for web integration:

#### `operations.py`

No changes are necessary here; it already encapsulates the core logic of the operations.

#### `calculator.py`

Slight refactoring to remove any user interaction and focus purely on the calculator logic.

```python
# calculator.py

from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = {
            "1": Addition(),
            "2": Subtraction(),
            "3": Multiplication(),
            "4": Division()
        }

    def add_operation(self, key, operation):
        """Allows adding new operations without modifying existing code."""
        if isinstance(operation, Operation):
            self.operations[key] = operation

    def get_operation(self, choice):
        """Retrieves the selected operation based on user input."""
        return self.operations.get(choice, None)

    def perform_operation(self, operation, x, y):
        """Performs the operation and returns the result."""
        return operation.execute(x, y)
```

#### `services.py`

This service layer encapsulates the business logic, making it easy to adapt for different interfaces (CLI, web, etc.).

```python
# services.py

from calculator import Calculator
from history_manager import save_history

calculator = Calculator()

def calculate(choice, num1, num2):
    """Handles calculation requests."""
    operation = calculator.get_operation(choice)
    if not operation:
        return {"error": "Invalid operation"}
    result = calculator.perform_operation(operation, num1, num2)
    save_history(choice, num1, num2, result)
    return {"result": result}
```

#### `history_manager.py`

Refactor this to allow switching between JSON and database-based storage easily.

```python
# history_manager.py

import json
import os

HISTORY_FILE = 'history.json'

def save_history(operation, x, y, result):
    """Saves the calculation history to a JSON file."""
    if not os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
        with open(HISTORY_FILE, 'w') as file:
            json.dump([], file)

    history_entry = {
        "operation": operation,
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "result": result
    }

    with open(HISTORY_FILE, 'r+') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        data.append(history_entry)
        file.seek(0)
        json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

def get_history():
    """Returns the history of calculations."""
    if not os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
        return []

    with open(HISTORY_FILE, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)
```

#### `routes.py` (For Web App)

This module will define the web routes/endpoints for a Flask app, allowing it to handle requests.

```python
# routes.py

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from services import calculate
from history_manager import get_history

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/calculate', methods=['POST'])
def calculate_route():
    data = request.json
    choice = data.get('choice')
    num1 = data.get('num1')
    num2 = data.get('num2')
    result = calculate(choice, num1, num2)
    return jsonify(result)

@app.route('/history', methods=['GET'])
def history_route():
    history = get_history()
    return jsonify(history)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Refactoring Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The refactor clearly separates core functionality, services, data management, and user interfaces, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability.

2. **API-Ready**: The design makes the code easily adaptable for a REST API, paving the way for web or mobile applications.

3. **Swappable Persistence Layer**: By refactoring history management, it’s easy to switch between JSON files and more robust database systems.

4. **Ease of Testing**: Each module is self-contained, making unit tests straightforward with minimal dependencies.

5. **Web Application Compatibility**: The service layer directly translates to web routes, meaning the transition to web is almost seamless.

This setup will allow you to migrate to a web application without major rewrites, focusing instead on connecting the already modular business logic to web-based endpoints.


6th Prompt: "What is the best way to deploy this application?"
------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Deploying this application as a web application involves several considerations, including scalability, ease of maintenance, and security. The best deployment strategy depends on the application's expected load, budget, and growth potential. Below are the most effective deployment strategies, focusing on modern, scalable approaches using cloud services and containerization.

### Deployment Strategy Overview

1. **Containerization with Docker**: Package the application into containers using Docker, making it portable and easy to deploy across different environments.

2. **Use a Cloud Platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)**: Deploy the application on a cloud service provider to leverage managed services like databases, autoscaling, and load balancing.

4. **Managed Database Services**: Use managed databases like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure Database to handle the data persistence layer, providing automatic backups, scaling, and maintenance.

### Detailed Deployment Plan

#### 1. **Containerization with Docker**

**Why Docker?**
- Docker provides a consistent runtime environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- It simplifies deployment across different stages (development, testing, production).

**Steps to Dockerize the Application:**

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Define the environment for your application, including installing necessary packages, copying the code, and setting up the application server.

    ```Dockerfile
    # Dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.11-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the requirements file into the container
    COPY requirements.txt .

    # Install dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . .

    # Expose port 5000 to the host
    EXPOSE 5000

    # Define environment variable
    ENV FLASK_APP=routes.py

    # Run the application
    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:

    ```bash
    docker build -t calculator-app .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 calculator-app
    ```

4. **Push to a Container Registry**: Push the Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or Google Container Registry.

    ```bash
    docker tag calculator-app <your-registry>/calculator-app
    docker push <your-registry>/calculator-app
    ```

#### 2. **Deploy on a Cloud Platform**

**Choose a Cloud Provider**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure are popular choices due to their reliability and extensive ecosystem.

**Option A: AWS Deployment using Elastic Beanstalk**

- **Elastic Beanstalk** provides an easy way to deploy and manage applications in the cloud without worrying about the infrastructure.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application**: Go to the AWS Management Console and create a new Elastic Beanstalk application.
  2. **Deploy Dockerized App**: Choose the Docker platform and upload your Docker image from your container registry.
  3. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure environment variables for your application if needed (e.g., database connection strings).
  4. **Monitor and Scale**: Use the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard to monitor performance, set up scaling rules, and handle deployment updates.

**Option B: Google Cloud Run**

- **Google Cloud Run** is a fully managed compute platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Build and Push the Docker Image**: Push your Docker image to Google Container Registry.
  2. **Deploy to Cloud Run**: Use the Cloud Run console or CLI to deploy the application directly from the container registry.
  3. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure environment variables for connecting to databases and other services.
  4. **Autoscaling and Monitoring**: Cloud Run automatically handles scaling based on traffic.

#### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

To automate deployment and ensure that updates are seamless, set up a CI/CD pipeline.

**Using GitHub Actions**:

1. **Create a Workflow File (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**:

    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Set up Docker
            uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

          - name: Build Docker image
            run: docker build -t calculator-app .

          - name: Log in to Docker Hub
            run: echo ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }} --password-stdin

          - name: Push Docker image
            run: docker push calculator-app

          - name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
            uses: einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy@v20
            with:
              aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
              aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}
              application_name: 'calculator-app'
              environment_name: 'calculator-app-env'
              version_label: ${{ github.sha }}
              region: 'us-west-2'
              wait_for_environment: true
    ```

2. **Configure Secrets**: Add required secrets (e.g., Docker Hub credentials, AWS credentials) in the repository settings.

#### 4. **Managed Database Services**

**Use Managed Databases**:
- Use AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure Database for easy scaling, backups, and high availability.
- Update your application to connect to the managed database instead of local JSON files.

**Database Migration**:
- Use tools like Flask-Migrate (for Flask apps) to handle database schema changes and migrations.

#### 5. **Monitoring and Security**

- **Set Up Monitoring**: Use cloud monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, or Azure Monitor to keep track of application performance.
  
- **Security**: 
  - Use environment variables to manage sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database passwords).
  - Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
  - Set up proper IAM roles and permissions to restrict access.
